<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Sharon. I am currently learning front-end development but
I would like to learn back-end as well. I have visited a few forums on the
subject and from what I gather it is not easy to learn. This can at times 
be somewhat discouraging but I try to remain positive and just keep telling
myself that persistence is key. I hope to learn and really understand what 
I am in taught in this class.</p>

<h1>When I have free time</h1>

<ul>
  <li>I love cats and enjoy watching them in their environment.</li>
  <li>I love makeup, I really enjoy shopping for makeup and can spend hours watching tutorials.</li>
  <li>Although studying is not something that I enjoy, I put forth an effort to do it as I realize how beneficial it is. I try to educate myself on different subjects.</li>
</ul>
